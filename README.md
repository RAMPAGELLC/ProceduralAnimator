# Procedural Animator Module for Roblox
                                                                         
## Overview
The Procedural Animator module provides a versatile and modular system to animate Roblox models procedurally. It supports multiple animation types, offering full control over playback, pausing, resuming, and stopping animations.

## Features
- **Supported Animation Types**:
  - `LegoBuilding`: Sequential "building" effect.
  - `Wave`: Smooth oscillating motion.
  - `Bounce`: Adds a bouncing effect.
  - `Spiral`: Spiral-like movement toward the goal.
  - `Explosion`: Parts "explode" outward and regroup at the goal.
- **Dynamic Speed Control**: Animation duration is calculated based on the `Speed` parameter.
- **Event-driven Design**: Emits events for `Started`, `Paused`, `Resumed`, and `Completed` states.
- **PrimaryPart Auto-Setting**: Automatically sets the `PrimaryPart` if not defined.
- **Force-to-Goal Functionality**: Snaps parts to their final positions when stopped.

## Configuration
The module uses a flexible configuration structure:

| **Parameter**     | **Type**                | **Description**                                                       |
|--------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Origin`          | `Vector3?`             | Starting position for the animation.                                  |
| `Goal`            | `CFrame?`              | Final position of the model.                                          |
| `AnimationType`   | `string`               | Type of animation (e.g., "Wave", "Bounce").                           |
| `Speed`           | `number`               | Speed of the animation; inversely affects tween duration.             |
| `EasingStyle`     | `Enum.EasingStyle`     | Easing style for the animation.                                       |
| `EasingDirection` | `Enum.EasingDirection` | Easing direction for the animation.                                   |
| `Amplitude`       | `number?`              | Height of wave-like animations.                                       |
| `Frequency`       | `number?`              | Density of wave oscillations.                                         |
| `PartDelay`       | `number?`              | Delay between parts in sequential animations.                         |
| `RandomizeStart`  | `boolean?`             | Enables randomized starting positions for parts.                      |

## Usage Examples
### 1. LegoBuilding Animation
Creates a sequential "building" effect where parts animate into place one after the other.

```lua
local ProceduralAnimator = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.ProceduralAnimatorModule)
local config = {
    Origin = Vector3.new(0, 100, 0),
    Goal = workspace.Model:GetPivot(),
    AnimationType = "LegoBuilding",
    Speed = 1,
    EasingStyle = Enum.EasingStyle.Quad,
    EasingDirection = Enum.EasingDirection.Out,
    PartDelay = 0.1,
    RandomizeStart = false,
}
local animation = ProceduralAnimator.new(workspace.Model, config)
animation:Play()
```

### 2. Wave Animation
Adds a sinusoidal oscillation as parts animate to the goal.

```lua
local ProceduralAnimator = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.ProceduralAnimatorModule)
local config = {
    Origin = Vector3.new(0, 50, 0),
    Goal = workspace.Model:GetPivot(),
    AnimationType = "Wave",
    Speed = 2,
    Amplitude = 10,
    Frequency = 3,
    EasingStyle = Enum.EasingStyle.Sine,
    EasingDirection = Enum.EasingDirection.InOut,
}
local animation = ProceduralAnimator.new(workspace.Model, config)
animation:Play()
```

### 3. Bounce Animation
Adds a bouncing effect as parts animate to the goal position.

```lua
local ProceduralAnimator = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.ProceduralAnimatorModule)
local config = {
    Origin = Vector3.new(0, 50, 0),
    Goal = workspace.Model:GetPivot(),
    AnimationType = "Bounce",
    Speed = 1.5,
    Amplitude = 8,
    EasingStyle = Enum.EasingStyle.Elastic,
    EasingDirection = Enum.EasingDirection.Out,
}
local animation = ProceduralAnimator.new(workspace.Model, config)
animation:Play()
```

### 4. Spiral Animation
Parts animate in a spiral motion toward the goal.

```lua
local ProceduralAnimator = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.ProceduralAnimatorModule)
local config = {
    Origin = Vector3.new(0, 50, 0),
    Goal = workspace.Model:GetPivot(),
    AnimationType = "Spiral",
    Speed = 1,
    Amplitude = 12,
    Frequency = 2,
    EasingStyle = Enum.EasingStyle.Quad,
    EasingDirection = Enum.EasingDirection.Out,
}
local animation = ProceduralAnimator.new(workspace.Model, config)
animation:Play()
```

### 5. Explosion Animation
Parts "explode" outward and regroup at the goal position.

```lua
local ProceduralAnimator = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.ProceduralAnimatorModule)
local config = {
    Origin = Vector3.new(0, 50, 0),
    Goal = workspace.Model:GetPivot(),
    AnimationType = "Explosion",
    Speed = 1,
    explosionOffset = Vector3.new(10, 10, 10),
    explosionDistance = 20,
    explosionHeight = 5,
    EasingStyle = Enum.EasingStyle.Back,
    EasingDirection = Enum.EasingDirection.In,
}
local animation = ProceduralAnimator.new(workspace.Model, config)
animation:Play()
```

### Using Animation Module Methods

#### Play Animation
Starts the animation process.

```lua
animation:Play()
```

#### Stop Animation
Stops the animation. Use `forceToGoal` to snap all parts to the final position.

```lua
animation:Stop(true) -- Snaps parts to their goal position.
```

#### Pause Animation
Pauses the current animation.

```lua
animation:Pause()
```

#### Resume Animation
Resumes the animation from where it was paused.

```lua
animation:Resume()
```

#### Set to Origin
Resets the model to its starting position.

```lua
animation:SetToOrigin()
```

#### Animate to Goal
Animates the entire model to the goal position directly.

```lua
animation:AnimateToGoal()
```

### Adding New Animation Types
To create a new animation type:
1. Create a module inside the `Animations` directory.
2. Implement the following methods:
   - `Play(config: ProceduralAnimatorConfig, model: Model, state: ProceduralAnimatorState)`
   - `Stop(state: ProceduralAnimatorState)`
   - `Pause(state: ProceduralAnimatorState)`
   - `Resume(state: ProceduralAnimatorState)`
3. Register the module in the `Animations` folder. Example:

```lua
local CustomAnimation = {}
CustomAnimation.__index = CustomAnimation

function CustomAnimation.new()
    local self = setmetatable({}, CustomAnimation)
    return self
end

function CustomAnimation:Play(config, model, state)
    -- Implement animation logic here.
end

function CustomAnimation:Stop(state)
    -- Implement stopping logic here.
end

function CustomAnimation:Pause(state)
    -- Implement pause logic here.
end

function CustomAnimation:Resume(state)
    -- Implement resume logic here.
end

return CustomAnimation
```

## Adding New Animation Types
To add a new animation type:
1. Create a new module in the `Animations` directory.
2. Implement the `Play`, `Stop`, `Pause`, and `Resume` methods.
3. Register the module by placing it in the `Animations` folder.

## Dependencies
- **[FastSignal](https://github.com/fastrun1/FastSignal)**: For managing animation events.
- **ProceduralAnimators' Animation Modules**: Custom modules for each animation type.
